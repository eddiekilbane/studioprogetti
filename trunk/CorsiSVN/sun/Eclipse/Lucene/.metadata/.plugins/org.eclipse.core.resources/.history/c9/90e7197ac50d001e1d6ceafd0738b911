            "Most web applications run on top of HTTP. This protocol is a stateless series of client/" +
            "server message exchanges. Normally, the client is a web browser and the server is a" +
            "web or application server. The client initiates communication by sending a request for" +
            "a specific resource. The resource can be a static HTML document that exists on the" +
            "server’s local file system, or it can be a dynamically generated document with untold" +
            "complexity behind its creation." +
            "Much could be said about the HTTP protocol and the variety of ways of doing" +
            "things in this domain. We’ll limit ourselves to the most important implications as seen" +
            "from the perspective of a web application. We can start by noting that HTTP was not" +
            "originally designed to serve in the capacity that web application developers demand of" +
            "it. It was meant for requesting and serving static HTML documents. All web applications" +
            "built on HTTP must address this discrepancy." +
            "For web applications, HTTP has two hurdles to get over. It’s stateless, and it’s text" +
            "based. Stateless protocols don’t keep track of the relationships among the various" +
            "requests they receive. Each request is handled as if it were the only request the server" +
            "had ever received. The HTTP server keeps no records that would allow it to track and" +
            "logically connect multiple requests from a given client. The server has the client’s" +
            "address, but it will only be used to return the currently requested document. If the client" +
            "turns around and requests another document, the server will be unaware of this" +
            "client’s repeated visits." +
            "But if we are trying to build more complex web applications with more complicated" +
            "use cases, this won’t work. Take the simplest, most common case of the secure" +
            "web application. A secure application needs to authenticate its users. To do this, the" +
            "request in which the client sends the user name and password must somehow be associated" +
            "with all other requests coming from that client during that user session. Without" +
            "the ability to keep track of relationships among various requests, even this" +
            "Servlet" +
            "Figure 1.1 The Java Servlet API" +
            "exposes the HTTP client/server" +
            "protocol to the Java platform." +
            "Struts 2 is built on top of that." +
            "6 CHAPTER 1 Struts 2: the modern web application framework" +
            "introductory use case of modern web applications is impossible. This problem must" +
            "be addressed by every modern web application." +
            "Equally as troublesome, HTTP also is text based. Mating a text-based technology to" +
            "a strongly typed technology such as Java creates a significant amount of data-binding" +
            "work. While in the form of an HTTP request, all data must be represented as text" +
            "Somewhere along the way, this encoding of data must be mapped onto Java data types." +
            "Furthermore, this process must occur at both ends of the request-handling process." +
            "Incoming request parameters must be migrated into the Java environment, and outgoing" +
            "responses must pull data from Java back into the text-based HTTP response." +
            "While this is not rocket science, it can create mounds of drudge work for a web application." +
            "These tasks are both error-prone and time-consuming.";
